# Squishy's Server
 A repo for the Squishy's Server Lua Mod for sm64ex-coop, with the main goal to make my hosts have everything you would need quality of life wise!

 This repo is a resource if you're curious about how something in the mod is coded, Want to make optimization Pull Requests, or just hate long loading times and just want to download it here.

## Community Driven Project

 This mod is only possible because of not only the modders of coop, but everyone who has supported me while making this!

 Since this is a mod by the player, for the player, I want to make sure in can adapt to however *you* play! So please leave any suggestions you may have for features/additions, they make my hosts just that much better.

### Name-2-Model and DynOS Models

Squishy's Server allows for a multitude of custom character models, all being implemented via the Custom Menu. Any model you request is unique to You!

For more information on creating models, please check out [Trashcam's Modding Resources](https://github.com/TrashcamSaysFrick/sm64ex-coop-modding-resources) for more information. It's an amazing resource if you're just getting into making DynOS Models!

Once you have your .bin model, Just send it over to 6094Squishy#4111 on Discord or make a commit adding the model yourself, the table system used in name-2-model.lua is fairly simple and shouldn't be that hard to implement.

###### Note: This only makes your model selectable by you, and is liable to being distributed without your knowledge. Do not trust this project with your model if you want it to stay private!

### Optimization (Pull Requests)

 As I'm not too good at Lua, most of the code isn't optimized as much as it could be.

 I suggest if there is a problem optimization wise, you make a Pull Request! It helps the game not need to process as much and helps myself know how I can better code.
